This system handles automatic desktop background selection from a list
of images. To use it, place the desired images into the `all/` directory,
and add a symlink in the `active/` directory pointing to the image.

`select_background.sh` selects a background from `active/` at random and
sets it as the desktop background. Run this whenever you want to select
a new background.

`import.sh` handles adding and symlinking images for you. To use it,
just place the desired images in the `to_add/` directory and run the
script to add them.
